# Test: Division by zero

Assert that
       `calc.div(1,  1)` throws nothing
   and `calc.div(1, -1)` throws nothing
   and `calc.div(1,  0)` throws an instance e of `IllegalArgumentException`
                         such that `e.message` is `"div by zero"`
where calc = `new yokohama.unit.example.Calc()`.
